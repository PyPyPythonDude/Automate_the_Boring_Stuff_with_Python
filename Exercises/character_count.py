'''
This program loops over each character in the message variable's string,
counting how often each character appears. The setdefault() method ensures
that the key is in the count dictionary (with a default value of 0),so the
program doesn't throw a KeyError error when count[character] =
count[character] + 1 is executed.

message = 'It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.'
count = {}

for character in message:
    count.setdefault(character, 0)
    count[character] = count[character] + 1

print(count)
